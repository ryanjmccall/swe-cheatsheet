1) Download rabbitmq 
    MAC:
    a) `brew install rabbitmq`
       (This requires developer tools, so to do this you will need to have an updated Xcode developer tools.)
        This will install rabbitmq in the default Cellar. Probably located in /usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/3.3.5
    b) To run rabbitmq:
        `cd /usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/3.3.5/sbin`
        `sudo ./rabbitmq-server`
        Alternatively, you can add rabbitmq to your $PATH and will then be able to run rabbitmq commands from any 
        directory.
