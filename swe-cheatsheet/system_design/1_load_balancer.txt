Load balancing
- balance the load, improving responsiveness and availability
- takes request, hashes and sends to app server
- could also health check app servers
- have a caching layer

- mechanism
-- round robin, some machines are under heavy load
-- lead current load,
-- more than one to avoid single point of failure
--- DNS ('load balancer' for the web) can resolve to a number of IP addresses (load balancers)

- drawbacks
-- horizontally scaling is complex
-- adds complexity
-- could use microservices

- client to webserver, webserver to app server, app to database
