Way to have persistent disk storage
Db server provides an API

Common to ask design schema for database
- fields for each table
- foreign keys
- every table should have a unique id
- How to represent?
-- location: lat and long as Decimal (float or real for more precision)
-- date, time, datetime - integer
-- id use 64 bit integer
- don't store large data blobs, move out into a CDN, separate file system

- why is query slow? joins.
-- scan table 1, then scan table 2
-- index creates binary search tree, find in log(n) time
-- index on multiple fields

- too many indexes
-- adds space cost
-- slows down writes b/c have to update index

Think about what queries are required when designing table
