CDN - Content distribution network

Good for storing static files, images, videos, audio, html
- hosts files in different geographic locations
- cache your data in various locations


File cdn.mywebsite.com -> resolves to user-local webaddress
- pull-based - first request across the planet, CDN fetches files and stores locally
-- simple setup
-- cost based on usage

- push - upload files are pushed to servers so very first access is fast
-- manual maintenance
-- cost based on size

Example
- instead of http://fooapp.com/image.jpg, it would be http://cdn.fooapp.com/image.jpg
