How to scale out database?

Replication
- Master-master
-- multiple databases replicating each other
-- read/write into either one
-- more complicated
-- writes slower due to synchronization
-- consistency issues

- Master-slave
-- write master
-- read slaves
-- slaves replicate master
-- Good for read-heavy, write-light scenarios (e.g. youtube)
-- Pick one slave to perform a backup
