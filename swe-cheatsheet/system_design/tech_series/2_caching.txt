Hit cache server (or server) before db
- e.g., redis, cassandra, memcached (all in memory)

Cache invalidation
- cache and db out of sync
- user changes settings, remove value from cache
- store metadata according to timestamp
- cache key could be tied to hash of user settings
- write-through
-- change cache value, propagates change to db
-- write slow

- write-back
-- change cache on write
-- cron periodically writes cache back to db
-- cache dies -> lose unwritten data

- cache eviction
-- FIFO
-- LIFO
-- LRU

- think about it as a distributed dict
