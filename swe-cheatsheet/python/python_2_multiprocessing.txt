- Pool
p = Pool(5)
print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))

- Process
p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
p.start()
p.join()

Communication between processes
- Queue - thread & process safe
- Pipe - returns a pair of connection objects connected by a pipe which is duplex (two-way)

aConn, bConn = Pipe()
p = Process(target=f, args=(aConn,))
p.start()
print bConn.recv()
p.join()

Synchronization between processes
lock = Lock()
# pass to process which invokes acquire() and release()
