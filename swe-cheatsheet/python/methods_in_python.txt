Methods in Python
- method is a function stored as a class attribute
-> Pizza.get_size() -> unbound!
-> Pizza.get_size(Pizza(42)) -> 42

- Python binds all the methods from class Pizza to any instance of this class
- get bound instance
-> m = Pizza(42).get_size
-> m.__self__

- Python3 functions attached to class are not unbound rather are simple
function bound to an object if required

- Class methods - not bound to object, bound to class
- When to use?
-- Factory methods used to create an instance of the class
-- Static methods calling static methods
