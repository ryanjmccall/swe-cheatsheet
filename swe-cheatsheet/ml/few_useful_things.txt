A Few Useful Things
by Pedro Domingos

1) learning = representation + evaluation + optimization
a) representation
- feature vectors
- is classifier in hypothesis space

b) evalution (objective or scoring) function
- internal used by algorithm
- external one we want classifier to optimize

c) optimization
- search method to select best model
- common for new learners to start out with off-the-shelf optimizers,
later replaced by customed-designed ones

3) Generalization
- performance must be evaluated on a held-out test set to demonstrate generalization
